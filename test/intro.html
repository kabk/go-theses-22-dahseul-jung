      <h1>PROTECTING MY FORTRESS MADE OF BLANKETS </h1><br><br>

        <p> In my memory, I had my first room when I was about six years old,  this room was a small space. After entering the apartment it was the room that lied next to the kitchen. Vaguely do I remember that my parents left the door to my room open, and all of my family, that is my mother, father, and my older brother stopped by on their way to the kitchen and stared at me. When I remember that time, I actually have little memory of “my room” and wonder why? Although I had a desk in my bedroom I had to spend most of the time at the table in the center of the living room or in the kitchen. </p><br>

        <p> From some point onwards, I began to think that my parents often invaded my personal space without my permission and I felt that I was being "monitored" by them. Perhaps I was ten years old at that time. My parents' presence or what I perceived as their gaze was uncomfortable for me, but there was no place in the house that I could hide at, there was no place that their sight or concern could not reach. I always had an idea or an expectation of what my space should be. Or what it could be under these circumstances. </p><br>

        <p>The first “space” that belonged entirely to myself was a diary that had a key lock, followed by the inside of the closet in my room, and third a little self-constructed space that included “walls and roofs” made of blankets that covered a laundry drying rack and chairs. I used to take a basket of tangerines and comic books of tacky romance novels that I liked and would read them there. Sometimes I invited intimate friend to share my secret stories in a lower voice in that hideout so that anyone could not be heard. However, when my parents came back home from work in the evening, they were surprised that the household items were messy and scolded me for disturbing “our community space.” And soon, the materials that were the walls and the roofs of my hideout were returned to where they had been before. In just a few hours, my perfect space was destroyed and disappeared. Although my times in those spaces I built were short, the comfort and freedom that I experienced in there still remain with me as intense memories. </p><br><br>
        
        <p>I did my best to protect my place by constantly building a temporary installation that fit the size of my body. After my childhood years and no longer creating such a small and maybe “childish” and playful hideout, I forced my door close and began to get angry at family members entering the room without asking for my permission. Frequent quarrels with my parents followed over this issue, and I was criticised for being an “individualist” who ignores community life with family. Nowadays one might have called me an introvert, too. Who knows? At that time, when my father came home from work, he often wanted to talk with me in the living room, but I shut my door. I remember that he once told me that I was an “undutiful” daughter. When I shared this problem with my friends around me, I came to learn that it was a common issue in the general family in Korea. Many parents induce children and adolescents to spend time in the living room with their families, and sit around the table and have dinner together.</p><br>

        <p>There was always a scarcity of my own space, perhaps because of the experiences I had when I was young so I longed for my own space. When I moved to Holland by myself to study, I had expectations and wishes rather than fears of being alone. Finally, I was about to live alone. Now that I have been living alone in the Hague for four years I asked myself again: Do you have a complete space for yourself now?</p><br>

        <p>Strangely enough, I feel incomplete as ever.<br>
        Why doesn't the house, where I live alone, still feel like my own space? </p><br>
        
        <p>Perhaps, I might be chasing the clumsy hideout that I made as a child, with my body-sized furnitures. In my heading direction, there is a sense of accomplishment that I felt after creating the secret space, a sense of liberation that I gained independence, a sense of belief that I will not be blamed by anyone, a sense of comfort that I felt from soft touch and scent. All these emotions I remember end up reaching out, missing my innocent childhood.</p>
