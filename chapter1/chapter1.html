As a result, people who are generous, helpful, and dependable to members of society are regarded as “good” people. On the other hand, individualism encourages people to value independence and self-reliance, as well as exercising their goals and desires rather than prioritizing the gain and state of social groups. Within individualistic cultures, people expect to learn and discover various personalities and values in society.
