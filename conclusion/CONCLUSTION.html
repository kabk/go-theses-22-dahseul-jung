              <p>This research has aimed to understand why people require their own space and how it can influence people when it exists in various forms; physical space, mental space, and virtual spaces. This began with my personal story, a story about my memories and emotions, about building a blanket fort in my childhood, but I discovered that it could be expanded into many stories; stories that apply to many people. Stories that are universal because “personal space" is an instinct inherent in all human beings and a field that is still being wriggled and developed.</p></br>

              <br><p>The first chapter discusses the impact of community spirit, an important traditional value in Korea, on personal space in Korean society. It leads to a story of how difficult it is to guarantee individual space in a typical Korean family and house form, and what is the unique culture derived from it. Personal space, according to the second chapter, extends beyond physical territory into the psychological domain. People cognitively form their space with energy through accumulated time and memory. Finally, the third chapter is about how far the virtual world, an imaginary space, has progressed and how it has become a reality of its own. The virtual world has become greatly integrated into our daily lives, where people are strutting space and communicating with others regularly. Even though it is an intangible and invisible space, the emotions and experiences that occur there are all real, and should be considered.</p></br>

              <br><p>The process of my research was a journey to find out where my desire, from a young age, for personal space began. We unconsciously remember the space in our mother’s womb from birth and try to replicate its form, touch, and emotion while living. We keep trying to create a completely comfortable space like the womb because we are living in a world full of the unstable and hazardous. In public space, we naturally create and reveal our own space by establishing a certain distance from others to protect our bodies. We are all trying to find a safe and comfortable space in the invisible bubble around us.</p></br>
