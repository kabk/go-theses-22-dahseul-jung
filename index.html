     This space, Torenstraat 366, where I am writing this paper, and before there were several spaces that I have inhabited and passed by, the primary space was my mother’s womb. It was the best place to be warm, comfortable, naturally energized and protected. However after 10months of life there, we face a new space in defenseless state. </h1>
    <h1>
    Anthropologist John.S Allen said that we humans are a species of “homebodies”. The disposition of a human to possess space might be an intense instinct naturally inherent in us, along with the shapes of the “house” that mankind has embodied over the past two million years. </h1>
    <h1>
     This thesis begins with the memories related to “my space” that I experienced and felt while living with my family before I came to Holland. I have had a room for myself with a door that I could shut since I have been six years old. Despite my parents calling it “Dahseul’s room”, the door was always left open as my parents wished. Often they entered  my space without really requesting my permission. </h1>
    <h1>
     For me it was an invasion of my space, but for my parents it came with the value of “community life” and social life. In order to avoid uncomfortable feelings that I don’t know where these stem from, I used to spend time in a little self-constructed space made of blankets that covered a laundry drying rack and chairs. In my memory it was a “complete my space”. </h1>
    <h1>
     Gradually I realized that the experience was not just my own experience, but others experienced this, too. A collective memory that was created by a certain notion of community and being together, a social culture. <h1>
    <h1>
     Therefore, I would like to explore the origin of family culture in my home town or country and wish to share stories about “private space” with friends who originate from different geographic, cultural, and historicalbackgrounds.</h1>
