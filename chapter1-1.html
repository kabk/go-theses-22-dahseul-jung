    <p>CHAPTER 1. Rice versus Wheat</p><br>

        <p> I didn't write this thesis to unconditionally criticise any ‘collective life’ that my parents forced me to have. It is more a process of trying to understand them, or to analyse and explore why I struggled and obsessed over protecting my space, and still feel inadequate about my boundaries of my own space. Unexpectedly, the roots of community spirit, which are common in general families in Korea, were able to be informed by the practice of rice farming —depending on geographical conditions. On the other hand, individualism, which is usually described as a Western culture was closely related to wheat. <a href="https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=954020088007069018009093087019006070007012064010087068076004028072073014101095009071027102040034061127107010021086000024080102117042055041008009096089117007002090102081062010005109116072007069088025116025119070071069126116017089000005126090092120003116&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE">[1]</a></p><br>

        <p> Individualism and collectivism was proposed by Dutch social psychologist Geert Hofstede in his landmark study culture's Consequence(1980). And the psychological perspective that we understand now individualism and collectivism is composed by Greek psychologist Harry C. Triandis. He argues that individualism and collectivism are classified according to ‘whether the criteria for individual behavior are in individual or in the group to which the individual belongs. In other words, if you have a reason for doing something to yourself, it is individualism, and if you are in the interests of your group, you are classified as collectivism. Harry C. Triandis defined individualism and collectivism in ‘Individualism-Collectivism and Personality’ published in 2002. <a href="https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=954020088007069018009093087019006070007012064010087068076004028072073014101095009071027102040034061127107010021086000024080102117042055041008009096089117007002090102081062010005109116072007069088025116025119070071069126116017089000005126090092120003116&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE">[2]</a>  The meaning of Collectivism he defined is "Perhaps the most important dimension of cultural difference in social behavior, across the diverse cultures of the world, is the relative emphasis on individualism v. collectivism. In individualist cultures, most people’s social behavior is largely determined by personal goals, attributes, and values of collectiveities (family, co-workers, fellow parts are double here…determined by… </p><br>

        <p>1-1. Why Korea likes to use the word “we” more than “I”?</p><br>

        <p>As mentioned earlier, the origin of Korea’s “collectivism” might origin in Korea’s geographical conditions. Associate Professor of Behavioral Science NAME ? At the University of Korea belongs to a temperate wet climate with an average annual precipitation of more than 1,000 millimeters, thus, it is a suitable land and climate for rice farming. Therefore, Koreans have been a nation that mainly depends on eating rice. The rice crop development in rainy conditions, and agricultural land due to be some standing water on water on the stock loan ‘irrigation’ is essential. In order to share the water among the farmers, people have created a waterway that can deliver water, and houses are located around the waterway and developed into a form of village where neighbors gathered nearby. In addition, cooperative labor was intensively needed in a short period since farming time of rice was short, the villagers helped each other with their work and built a community spirit. The long-standing rice farming culture has created values that emphasize mutual relationship between people in Korean society.  </p><br>
        
        <p>On the contrary, the average annual precipitation is less than 1,000 millimeters, and  wheat farming has developed in the western region where rain has fallen evenly over the year. The characteristics of wheat are that not necessary to build irrigation facilities on agricultural land because it usually grows well in ordinary lands without water, and the land that once farmed wheat was unable to repeat cultivation due to the function of ground was weakened at that time. In other words, wheat farming does not require work in cooperation. It has frequently migrated to find new wheat fields; It has naturally led to the form of individualistic personality in the western region.</p><br>

        <p>The interdependent social culture across Korea can also be discovered in language, Korean. The obvious evidence to find in Korean is that the plural pronoun ‘we’ is much used instead of ‘I’. For example, instead of “my” family and “my” house, it is described as “our” family and “our” house.</p><br>

        <p>Strangely enough, I feel incomplete as ever.<br>
        Why doesn't the house, where I live alone, still feel like my own space? </p><br>
        
        <p>Perhaps, I might be chasing the clumsy hideout that I made as a child, with my body-sized furnitures. In my heading direction, there is a sense of accomplishment that I felt after creating the secret space, a sense of liberation that I gained independence, a sense of belief that I will not be blamed by anyone, a sense of comfort that I felt from soft touch and scent. All these emotions I remember end up reaching out, missing my innocent childhood.</p>
